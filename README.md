# Crare
Provides fasthttp and net/http dual network libraries at the same time!


Use this branch if you want to try out the latest features.
If you're after stability, then use the [original project](https://github.com/tucnak/telebot).


If you need some examples, I'll put them in this [organization](https://github.com/gotelebot/).


This is a fork of https://github.com/tucnak/telebot . This library requires minimum go1.21.3
